It is not possible to find an exact solution for partial differential equations in general.
So instead of trying to find an explicit formula for the ash concentration, one tries to find an approximate solutions with the help of computer algorithms.\par
The field of mathematics, that is concerned with developing effective algorithms to find such solutions and also to justify theoretically,
that the solutions that are found by these algorithms approximate the mathematical problem correctly, is called numerical mathematics.\par
The first step is to decompose the domain into finite many cells. Also the time intervall, for which a solution is to be found, is split into smaller intervalls.
Then for each cell a finite set of so called ansatzfunctions is given.
The main idea is to find for each point in time a combination of the ansatzfunctions, which is in some sense close to a function fulfilling the partial differential equation.
