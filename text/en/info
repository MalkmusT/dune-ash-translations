\page{Overview}{
  This program is a \emph{numerical simulation} of the propagation of an ash cloud
  caused by a volcano eruption at a constant height in a given wind field.
  This project was motivated by the eruptions of the Icelandic volcanoes
  \link{volcano2010}{Eyjafjallajökull} in 2010 and
  \link{volcano2011}{Grímsvötn} in 2011.\par

  In this program you can interactively simulate such an event in central Europe.
  The program will lead you step-by-step through the setup of the simulation and
  visualize the results.\par

  You can choose the volcano's position, specify the wind and set the diffusion
  rate of the ash. Once results are computed, they are played back on the map. 
  Additionally, the wind and the underlying mesh can be displayed on the map for several
  degrees of fineness. \par

\page{Volcanic Activity}{
\font{DejaVuSerif}{24}

A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or crust, which allows hot magma, 
volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface.
Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging.\par

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused 
by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart
the \nobreak{Pacific Ring of Fire} has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together.
By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. 
Volcanoes can also form where there 
is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust in the interiors of plates, e.g., 
in the East African Rift and the Rio Grande Rift in North America. \par

Volcanic activity away 
from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes. These so-called "hotspots", for example Hawaii, 
are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 km deep in the Earth.
\par
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a 
threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by 
the high operating temperature. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of 
sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere. however, they 
also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Historically, 
so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines. \par

%[volcano2010]
\page{Eyjafjallajökull}{
  The volcano Eyjafjallajökull is located under the glacier of the same name in southern Iceland.\par

  The first phase of the 2010 eruption began on 20 March and had only local impact. On 14 April 
  a second, explosive phase began and volcanic ash was thrown several kilometers into the air.
  In May the volcanic activity began subside and was declared over in October 2010.\par

  The eruption injected an ash plume into the jet stream and the ash was subsequently transported
  over northern Europe.
  Due to the lack of guidelines for the tolerable ash concentration in the air,
  the airspace over large parts of Europe was closed from April 15 to April 21,
  by which time around 95,000 flights had been canceled.
  Again on 4 and 5 May the airspace over Ireland, North Ireland and Scotland was closed,
  on 9 May over Spain, Portugal, Austria and parts of Italy and Germany and on 16 May again
  over Ireland and the UK.\par

  As a reaction to the flight cancellations, new security guidelines
  concerning the tolerable ash concentration were adopted.
  The estimated financial loss for the airlines was about €1.3 billion.
  Other industries were affected as well because of transportation and supply difficulties.

%[volcano2011]
\page{Grímsvötn}{
  The volcano Grímsvötn is located under the glacier Vatnajökull in the highlands of Iceland.\par
  
  On 21 May 2011 the volcano began to erupt and on the evening of the day the
  ice cover of the glacier broke. 
  The eruption plume quickly rose to a height of 20 km but subsequently fell to
  an average height of 10 km.
  On 24 May the eruption was weakening and stopped finally on 25 May.\par

  During the period from 22 to 25 May the ash cloud hindered air travel in several European
  countries and a total of 900 flights had to be canceled. On 22 May Iceland closed down its main 
  airport and by 23 May parts of the danish airspace were closed. On 24 May airports in Scotland,
  North Ireland and northern England were closed and on 25 May some airports in northern Germany
  were closed till the afternoon.\par

  While the aftermath of the eruption was smaller than the one from the eruption of the 
  Eyjafjallajökull in the previous year the total volume of ash produced by the eruption was 
  actually much higher. New guidelines for air travel adopted after the events from 
  the previous year, less aggressive ash characteristics and more favorable wind conditions helped 
  considerably to lessen the impact.\\

%[numericsold]
\page{Discretization}{
  In this simulation a splitting between the space and time discretization is
  applied, a technique known as the \emph{method of lines} in the literature.\par

  \section{Space Discretization}
  For the spacial discretization a \emph{Discontinuous Galerkin} (DG) method on
  a structured grid is used.
  This method is based on the decomposition of the domain (here the map of
  Europe) into 'small' quadrilaterals.
  On each quadrilateral, the solution is approximated by a bilinear function.
  The DG scheme gives a rule how to compute these bilinear functions.\par

  \section{Time Discretization}
  The observed time interval (0h - 100h) is subdivided into a finite number of
  time steps.
  A \emph{Runge-Kutta method} is then used to evolve the approximate ash
  concentration from one time step to the next.\par

  The software package \link{software}{\dunefem} is used to compute for the
  numerical simulations.
